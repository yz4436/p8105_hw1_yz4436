## Problem 1

Code to load the penguins dataset from a package “palmerpenguins”
containing the penguins dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

In order to get the mean of flipper length, I dropped NA in
flipper_length_mm column and then calculate the mean later in my
description.

``` r
penguins_withoutna = drop_na(penguins)
```

-   The data in this dataset, including names / values of important
    variables.
    -   There are eight variables in the dataset, which are named as
        species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
        flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year.
-   The size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol)
    -   There are 344 rows and 8 columns of the dataset, which is a
        dataset with a size of 344 \* 8.
-   The mean flipper length
    -   The mean of flipper_length_mm is 200.966967.

Using ggplot and geom_point() to make a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm
(y) vs bill_length_mm (x); color points using the species variable. I
use penguins_withoutna instead of penguins to avoid warning of NA.

``` r
ggplot(penguins_withoutna, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() 
```

## Problem 2

Creating a data frame comprised of 4 different type of variables, which
are norm_samp, norm_samp_positive, char_samp, factor_samp.

``` r
sample_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  norm_samp_positive = norm_samp > 0,
  char_samp = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  factor_samp = factor(c("10", "50", "10", "90", "10", "50", "50", "90", "50", "90"))
)
```

Tring to use mean() and pull() to take the mean of each variable in my
dataframe.

``` r
mean(pull(sample_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.1368928

``` r
mean(pull(sample_df, norm_samp_positive))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(sample_df, char_samp))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(sample_df, char_samp)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(sample_df, factor_samp))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(sample_df, factor_samp)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

-   What works and what doesn’t?
    -   I try to take the mean of all four variables. The first variable
        norm_samp and the second variable norm_samp_positive works, and
        the third variable char_samp and the fourth variable factor_samp
        does not work and return NA.

Applying the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor
variables to convert the type of variables to numeric. Usinh eval =
FALSE to show the chunk but not the output.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(sample_df, norm_samp_positive))
as.numeric(pull(sample_df, char_samp))
as.numeric(pull(sample_df, factor_samp))
```

-   After applying the as.numeric function to the logical, character,
    and factor variables. I found that logical variable changes to 0 of
    False and 1 of True, character variable changes to NA since letter
    could not be converted to numeric, and factor variable changes to 1
    of 10, 2 of 50, and 3 of 90 since I have three levels that ranked
    all 10 as level 1, all 50 as level 2, and all 90 as level 3.
-   When using pull function to take the mean, mean of double and
    logical variables could represent the real mean of themselves, so
    taking the mean of them works, but there is no actual meaning of the
    mean of characters and factors, so taking the mean of them does not
    work. Hence, this help explain what happened.
