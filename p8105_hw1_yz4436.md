## Problem 1

Code to load the penguins dataset from a package “palmerpenguins”
containing the penguins dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

In order to get the mean of flipper length, I dropped NA in
flipper_length_mm column and then calculate the mean later in my
description.

``` r
penguins_withoutna = drop_na(penguins)
```

-   The data in this dataset, including names / values of important
    variables.
    -   There are eight variables in the dataset, which are named as
        species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
        flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year.
-   The size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol)
    -   There are 344 rows and 8 columns of the dataset, which is a
        dataset with a size of 344 \* 8.
-   The mean flipper length
    -   The mean of flipper_length_mm is 200.966967.

Using ggplot and geom_point() to make a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm
(y) vs bill_length_mm (x); color points using the species variable. I
use penguins_withoutna instead of penguins to avoid warning of NA.

``` r
ggplot(penguins_withoutna, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() 
```

## Problem 2

Creating a data frame comprised of 4 different type of variables, which
are norm_samp, norm_samp_positive, char_samp, factor_samp.

``` r
sample_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  norm_samp_positive = norm_samp > 0,
  char_samp = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  factor_samp = factor(c("10", "50", "10", "90", "10", "50", "50", "90", "50", "90"))
)
```

Tring to use mean() and pull() to take the mean of each variable in my
dataframe.

``` r
mean(pull(sample_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.4123093

``` r
mean(pull(sample_df, norm_samp_positive))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(pull(sample_df, char_samp))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(sample_df, char_samp)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(sample_df, factor_samp))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(sample_df, factor_samp)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

-   What works and what doesn’t?
    -   I try to take the mean of all four variables. The first variable
        norm_samp and the second variable norm_samp_positive works, and
        the third variable char_samp and the fourth variable factor_samp
        does not work and return NA.
