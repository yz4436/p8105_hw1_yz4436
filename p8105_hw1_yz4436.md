## Problem 1

Code to load the penguins dataset from a package “palmerpenguins”
containing the penguins dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

In order to get the mean of flipper length, I dropped NA in
flipper_length_mm column and then calculate the mean later in my
description.

``` r
penguins_withoutna = drop_na(penguins)
```

-   The data in this dataset, including names / values of important
    variables.
    -   There are eight variables in the dataset, which are named as
        species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
        flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year.
-   The size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol)
    -   There are 344 rows and 8 columns of the dataset, which is a
        dataset with a size of 344 \* 8.
-   The mean flipper length
    -   The mean of flipper_length_mm is 200.966967.

Using ggplot and geom_point() to make a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm
(y) vs bill_length_mm (x); color points using the species variable. I
use penguins_withoutna instead of penguins to avoid warning of NA.

``` r
ggplot(penguins_withoutna, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() 
```

## Problem 2

Creating a data frame comprised of 4 different type of variables, which
are norm_samp, norm_samp_positive, char_samp, factor_samp.

``` r
sample_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  norm_samp_positive = norm_samp > 0,
  char_samp = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  factor_samp = factor(c("10", "50", "10", "90", "10", "50", "50", "90", "50", "90"))
)
```
