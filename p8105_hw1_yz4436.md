## Problem 1

Code to load the penguins dataset from a package “palmerpenguins”
containing the penguins dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

In order to get the mean of flipper length, I dropped NA in
flipper_length_mm column and then calculate the mean later in my
description.

``` r
penguins_withoutna = drop_na(penguins)
```

-   The data in this dataset, including names / values of important
    variables.
    -   There are eight variables in the dataset, which are named as
        species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
        flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year.
-   The size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol)
    -   There are 344 rows and 8 columns of the dataset, which is a
        dataset with a size of 344 \* 8.
-   The mean flipper length
    -   The mean of flipper_length_mm is 200.966967.

``` r
ggplot(penguins_withoutna, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() 
```
